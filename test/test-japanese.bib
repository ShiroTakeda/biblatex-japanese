                  amorphous silica. The complex itself is of very high thermal
                  stability. However, TEM observations, hot filtration,
                  reusability, and poisoning tests all revealed that the complex
                  acted only as a precatalyst to highly active Pd species in
                  Mizoroki–Heck reactions when immobilized. The complex appears
                  more stable when used under homogeneous reaction
                  conditions. The immobilized complex afforded high turnover
                  numbers, 104–105. The higher turnover frequencies were
                  realized at the lower Pd concentrations, which is a
                  characteristic property of ligand-free Pd catalyzed
                  reactions.}

                  formulation of international trade found in most computable
                  general equilibrium (CGE) models. International trade
                  structures consistent with the monopolistic competition models
                  suggested by Krugman (1980) and Melitz (2003) are presented in
                  a computational setting. The Melitz structure of heterogeneous
                  firms is particularly appealing given its consistency with
                  micro-level findings on firm sizes and export behavior. We
                  broaden the accessibility of these advanced trade theories for
                  CGE modelers, and strengthen the link between contemporary CGE
                  analysis and the broader trade community. Small-scale examples
                  of all three theories (Armington, Krugman and Melitz) are
                  introduced under a unified treatment. This is helpful in
                  translating the advanced theories into an environment that is
                  more familiar to CGE modelers. It is also helpful in showing
                  how the different approaches affect outcomes, in a relatively
                  transparent setting. Moving to an applied setting, we offer
                  our approach to calibration and computation of models that
                  include the Melitz heterogeneous firms structure. Our
                  applications include an analysis of economic integration and
                  subglobal climate policy in a model calibrated to the Global
                  Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) data. We do find that the
                  heterogeneous firms structure matters for conclusions drawn
                  from empirical CGE analysis. In our analysis of economic
                  integration we find endogenous entry leading to important
                  variety effects. We also find important productivity effects
                  related to the competitive selection of more productive
                  firms. In our examination of subglobal climate policy we see
                  substantial trade diversion in the Melitz structure. This
                  exacerbates the problem of carbon leakage and impacts the
                  emissions yields from carbon-based tariffs.}
